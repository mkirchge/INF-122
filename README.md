# Behave! Token Management System
Child token management application I wrote for my Informatics 122 (Software Design: Structure &amp; Implementation) class. It is a command-line interface. 

## Behave! Assignment Description

Teaching children good behavior is a central activity to parenting. Generally there are two models for doing so:

* Positive reinforcement, in which children are rewarded for good behavior. For example, a parent may add a marble to a cup every time the child exhibits good behavior, and after a certain number of marbles are collected, the child may cash them in for a reward (like ice cream, a new video game, etc.) (The parent could also remove marbles for bad behavior.)
* Punishment, in which children are given negative consequences for bad behavior. With this model, a parent may add a marble to a cup every time the child exhibits bad behavior, and after a certain number of marbles are collected, the child must experience some negative consequence (like losing video game privileges, doing extra chores, etc.) (The parent could also remove marbles for good behavior.)

In either model, parents often find it hard to keep track of a child’s rewards or consequences, especially when they have multiple children. Thus, your client wants you to develop Behave!, a program that allows parents to manage their children’s behavior by keeping track of their rewards and/or consequences, much like in the above examples, but in an automated way. Below are the detailed requirements for Behave! The program will be developed in Java.

In Behave!, all behavior is rewarded/punished in the form of tokens. Tokens are equivalent to marbles in the above examples.

A parent must choose a mode for each child: positive or negative.

* In positive mode, tokens are positive, meaning that the parent gives the child one or more tokens for good behavior (as in example 1 above), and can take them away for bad behavior. In this mode, tokens should look positive (e.g., have a happy face on them).
* In negative mode, tokens are negative, meaning that the parent gives the child one or more tokens for bad behavior (as in example 2 above), and can take them away for good behavior. In this mode, tokens should look negative (e.g., have a sad face on them).
